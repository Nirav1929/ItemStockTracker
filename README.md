By default, the GUI will already contain some data, which is loaded from `data/tracker.txt`. To add your own items, click the plus button in the upper right. You will be prompted to enter a name for the item you are tracking, along with a URL for a specific product page. Currently, `amazon.com`, `bestbuy.com` and `walmart.com` product pages are supported.

## Improvements over previous versions
1. Extended functionality of the application by supporting new websites that can be tracked like walmart.
2. Since cost is also a major factor for making the purchase decision we added a column to show the current price of the item without constantly checking the websites saving lot of time when comparing between different websites.
3. Enhanced deployment by creating an executable file that can be installed on both Windows and MacOS
4. In the prior implementation the availability notification was a pop-up which might be missed if the application is minimized. We have integrated the notifications to the system for both Windows and MacOS
5. Implemented auto launch during system startup, limited to Windows OS.
6. We have added a functionality to minimize the application to system tray.
7. Added Black and github actions to automatically check for formatting errors and run test cases for each commit.
8. Multithreaded scrapers to run parallely using thread pools to fetch stock availability and prices.
9. Improved documentation in code, also providing clear instructions on setup and getting started.

## Future Goals
- Collect the in-stock drop data and predict the next drop time.
- More supported retailers.
- [Other enhancements](https://github.com/ramyasaimullapudi/ItemStockTracker/issues)
