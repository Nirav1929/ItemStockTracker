By default, the GUI will already contain some data, which is loaded from `data/tracker.txt`. To add your own items, click the plus button in the upper right. You will be prompted to enter a name for the item you are tracking, along with a URL for a specific product page. Currently, `amazon.com` and `bestbuy.com` product pages are supported.

You can also edit, add, or delete items by right-clicking on a selected item:

When an item is restocked, a popup will appear. Optionally, an email alert will also be sent to a specified address.
